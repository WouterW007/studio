## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a vibrant yellow (#D65027) associated with the 'Gaan Groepe' category to highlight key interactive elements and primary category indicators.
- Background color: A very light, desaturated yellow (#002B3A) provides a subtle backdrop, ensuring readability and a cohesive look without overwhelming the user.
- Accent color: Choose an analogous orange hue (#FFF) for secondary interactive elements. This color helps to distinguish less critical actions while remaining harmonious with the primary yellow.
- Maintain existing site fonts to keep in line with https://www.kerk.co.za/
- Incorporate category-specific icons with color-coding for visual emphasis of primary categories (Blue, Red, Purple, Yellow).
- Two-column layout for the group directory with filters on the left and group listings on the right, promoting clear navigation.
